🌦️ Weather Forecast Web App

A dynamic and responsive weather forecasting web application built using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript (ES6).
The app fetches real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and automatically updates the interface with interactive background videos, temperature, and descriptive weather information based on live conditions such as Clear, Clouds, Rain, Mist, Haze, and more.
